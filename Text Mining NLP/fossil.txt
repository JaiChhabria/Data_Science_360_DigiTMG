A broken watch for ‚Çπ7000!!!\n\n', '\n\n  Lesson learnt not to buy such stuff here best to buy from authorised showroom as the chronograph is not working in this watch\n\n', '\n\n  I received this watch and have immediately visited the store and checked with them whether it is real or fake. They certified that it is a real one. I suggest you all to do this.\n\n', '\n\n  Its is a fake product.I am posting few pics just have a look\n\n', '\n\n  Stop watch hands are faulty. Not calibrated to stop at 0. Warranty card missing. I got an used product as the protective tape on the strap was missing. The joints of the strap are discolored.\n\n', '\n\n  The quality, as expected, is the best in the market. Though I got it at a price of Rs. 5900, the original price is like a bit too high, but the benefits that come with them totally justifies the price.\n\n', "\n\n  It's been exactly one year that I have used this watch.I was pretty thrilled when I bought it.For me it was personally a great learning that even Amazon sells duplicate products. As you can see in the photo attached, the chain lost its elegant black color within in just 3 months of use, one block of the chain was defected and it's pin always used to come out. Due to this, the watch fell from my hand many times and ultimately it's glass got a big crack. I though of returning it, but I was too late.I bought another fossil for my dad from showroom and it turned out that this (Amazon) watch was a duplicate.\n\n", '\n\n  It‚Äôs simply awesome. my hubby liked a lot.best gift that we can give for anyone.the way they packed was great... delivered before expected time... better  gift for a best person üòä\n\n', "\n\n  I don't regret getting this but i am not happy as well. i've used a digital watch (Apple Watch 1) and a large analog Titan with white dial for a very long time. So, may be this is because of it, the black dial & the watch hands are difficult to read at very first glance. I have used few chronographs before but this is functionally not the best. I would any day prefer to exchange this for a CASIO Edifice. this is my first fossil. again not disappointed just not excited about it.\n\n", "\n\n  After receiving when I opened the Fossil metal box, the watch inside was in inverted position & it was disappointing to see that 1 pin of the belt had come off as shown in pics. I took it to a watch dealer to mend the belt and he also confirmed that the watch is original one. I checked the watch's chronograph features and it seems to be working fine. Also, it has original warranty card and watch manual within the box. So the watch is original, and I'm happy with it, it's just that the seller should take care of how he's selling/placing the watch inside the box.\n\n", '\n\n  color is being eroded\n\n', '\n\n  Poor quality product for 7k, watch glass had scratch, belt had discoloration. Disappointed with Cloudtail sellerReceived replacement watch, but the chrono hands are slightly dislocated. No warranty booklet in the watch box\n\n', "\n\n  Got this watch with one of the two buttons not working. The button for chronograph function was either already pressed or maybe defective because it didn't work. Not sure if anyone else got the watch with same problem. Rest it looked brand new with all the packing and plastic covering.\n\n", '\n\n  I am writing this review after using 10 days . Before purchasing i have gone through most of the reviews and specially which are below 3 stars and i too had doubts about its authenticity. First thing i do was ,i visited fossil service center and before resizing the chain i asked him to verify whether it is authentic or not and they confirmed that it is authentic. Even they updated my watch serial number in there database.About the look, so it is very pretty watch and ofcourse it is completely black so it will suits with formal and casual dress.\n\n', '\n\n  The colour on the straps started to fade away. I liked the look but quality of the watch was poor. I was wondering if I can get a good product, but all the three replacements which I tried were old or used watches. I assume Cloudtail does not have a new watch. Please remove this as this will only lead to returns.\n\n', '\n\n  Product is good and delicate , delivery is fast , only thing  disappointed me is it had minor dent on its strap.. but happy with product üëç\n\n', "\n\n  So, it's been around a month since I ordered this product. Got it very fast, thanks to amazon.I love how this one sits and looks all black and nice. The dial is big enough to stand out, but not too big to be bulky.However, I didn't like the Box it came in. If I'm paying 6K for a Wrist Watch, I would would want some fancy packing. But, oh well, we don't carry the box around now, do we?I recently registered my watch on official Fossil's website and seems like it went through just fine. So, seems like this is authentic.You won't be disappointed in the product. If you are willing to sped 5-6K on a wrist watch, this is the best one.\n\n", '\n\n  I received product seal got broken and paint tint on watch\n\n', '\n\n  Looks really good on hand.  Totally loving it. Matches with trend and looks stylish\n\n', '\n\n  Awesome product to buy. Once I got the watch I went to nearby show room to check the product is real or fake. But it is real one hope everyone can do that for confirmation.  Really looks good. Rate wise very good. All the dials are working properly. But product packaging needs to take care when I got the product package was not properly closed. It feels little bad. I got a Good product\n\n', '\n\n  There were scratches on the belt and it was stuck at the hinge (the place where the dial and belt meet), that joint did not move, maybe something defective about the screws.Overall, I did not expect such quality for a branded watch.\n\n', '\n\n  I am using this watch since 3 months, till now it‚Äôs working fine, It looks classy and decent.If you have doubts that it is original or not so make sure you visit near by fossil show room and ask them to verify your barcode, I have done that and mine one is original. One more thing you will find that in the joints of the chain straps black colour is not there so don‚Äôt worry it is with all the fossil watches.\n\n', '\n\n  Watch is good..... looks premium..... but I got one with scratches. So returned it.\n\n', "\n\n  worst watch when I received the watch it was looking like a refurbished watch. The black belt was polished and the colour was on my wrist so returned immediately . Don't buy it\n\n", '\n\n  Sub standard quality !! Was using it as my primary wrist watch till a week back. I was okay with the black paint fading out in less than 2 years time ( date purchased 02 Oct 2019) , but the locking pin snapping was just not expected. Either the fossil brand is overrated or the product on Amazon is duplicate. Going to ask for a replacement on the Fossil website now !! Bought it for over 9k two years back. Totally disappointed.\n\n', '\n\n  Glass getting scratches very easily. Strap damaged one day after the return period.The seal of the product was tampered while delivery.\n\n', "\n\n  The best watch I bought till date. It's actually an old product only available online at this point in time. But still it looks so fresh, trendy, classy and people will surely complement you. During sales you can get it for as cheap as 4.5k sometimes, which kind of makes it a great value for money buy.\n\n", "\n\n  The straps are getting scratch even with soft materials like plastic. It's black so scratches are so much visible.  Definitely not good painted or cheap paint is used. It also look like a low quality SS. Not sure if this product is genuine. If they are charging high, at least quality should be good. Sad!!\n\n", '\n\n  Quite a beautifully looking watch. Tried a number of ways possible to check if this is fake but failed possibly because this was shipped and sold by Cloudtail which of Amazon only. So no chance of this being a fake product. Nothing more to add besides this being a beautiful affordable genuine watch from Fossil.\n\n', "\n\n  It's an original product.. Firstly I was too much confused than I went to Fossil showroom and they verified it and told that ita an original one.. So buy it and don't fall for other bad reviews\n\n", "\n\n  We have received  duplicate  products which was agreed aftermultiple  call with amazon also we send back the product.  It was pathetic situation  on spend more then 10k products. I suggest  don't entertain  to buy this product\n\n", "\n\n  The product was either used or fake. Recieved it without any tag.. tag had already been cut out and the watch didn't even fit in the box send with it\n\n", "\n\n  Hi this product don't purchase because after one month keep struck timing watch not working properly as per my expectations it's running very slowly every after two days need to be set the time  now I am trying to return but time is over now its problem how can I keep touch. So friends my suggestion don't buy this product after you feel suffer\n\n", '\n\n  Received Fake watch.1.Redline under watch and2.Strip is having a different color other than black(Finishing). I know Fossil will not make such a kind of finishing. Please reconsider this supplier for your credit worthyness.\n\n', "\n\n  Product was in perfect condition, packaged well and delivered well within the delivery dates...Can't complain...The quality of the product is obviously great. Check with the barcode online the product is genuine and i didn't need to check it online the feel of the product exuberated quality... Very happy to have bought it at 6.7k\n\n", "\n\n  Somewhere in discription it is written to refer to size guide for strap length. It's a bit bulky and long strap watch. Three stars for not keeping the strap length option, and unsynchronized timer, it goes back by 5 min when reset, not to zero. Everything else is good.\n\n", '\n\n  I have revieved an used watch, the packaging was completely damaged and the watch was covered with full of dust, dint had any tags and covers on the belt. The quality of the belt was worst. Failed to impress and definitely Not worth 6-7k money.  Not recommended\n\n', '\n\n  Feels decent, does not feel durable because of black powder coating on some areas. Watch is also too heavy for its size.\n\n', "\n\n  I bought it for my Father.
